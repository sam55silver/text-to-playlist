# Text To Playlist

## Final Project for CSCI 444

During my time at St.FX, I took CSCI 444, a comprehensive machine learning course that covered a wide range of topics, from K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to advanced transformers. The course included numerous assignments, each focusing on a specific model within the machine learning landscape. As part of the course, we were assigned a final project that spanned the duration of the course, allowing students to apply these models to a unique problem of their choosing.

For my final project, I developed a text-to-playlist model. This model takes a user prompt and generates a playlist of songs that aligns with the input. At the time, many text-to-insertconceptinsertconcept models were emerging across the internet, so I wanted to explore this trend by creating something similar. Although I had never made this project public beyond the class, Iâ€™m proud of the learning process and the result, even with its rough edges. With some reflection, I decided to release it for others to explore. Initially, it was part of a private repository that housed all my course assignments. To keep those assignments private, I extracted this project into its own repository for public access.

## The Project

For a complete overview of the project, check out ./report.md, which details my thought process, the exploration behind the model, and includes several graphs along with the final outputs.
